# Welcome to  @swechronicles!

My GitHub repository serves as a collection of personal DIY projects, primarily intended for educational purposes. If you find any of these projects helpful, I encourage you to use, modify, and expand upon them. As Richard Feynman once said, 'I can't understand things that I cannot build.' This philosophy aligns closely with my own approach to learning, and I strive to tackle challenging engineering problems that are often overlooked. I hope that my efforts can contribute to your own learning journey.
